# Mario kart

A shot to reproduce MARIQ with open source softwares.

I used and modify the source code of this repository;

https://github.com/mikedeboer/mariokart

You have to launch the node server, that binds the python code to the mario kart game embedded in the notebook.


TODO: finish the supervised learning, predict the direction of the kart based on its position-angle.
TODO: when it's done, use reinforcement learning to make the algorithm robust when the kart drives near to walls (not well represented in the training dataset coming from my games)
TODO: mix the two algorithms to reproduce mariq
