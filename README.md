# Examples of machine learning applications

Some examples of machine learning with python (using jupyter notebooks), mostly using scikit-learn (and keras with tensorflow as backend).

For each algorithm, a minimal example is provided.

The repository is composed of three folders, studying respectively supervised, unspervised and reinforcement (TODO for reinforcement).

It is not designed to be a complete overview of ML at all; the repo illustrates the presentation 2020-05-20.pdf.

I recommend the following links:
